# Track Suggester

### Created by Alex Francois

## Description
Web site for track-suggester project. It includes a brief intro about Epicodus tracks and then asks the user to fill out survey. The questions have three answers and each answer the user provides corresponds to one of the 3 tracks provided. A variable in js calculates this response by counting the answer to one of the 3 tracks (the 3 "counts" are variables as well). Once all questions are answered the counts are tallied using the "count" variable and when the user clicks submit the track with the highest count will be displayed on screen. The user has the option to try again by clicking on a button on the output screen. This will refresh the page and the user can fill out the survey again.
